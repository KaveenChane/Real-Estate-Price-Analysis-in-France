# Real-Estate-Price-Analysis-in-France

The purpose of this project is to analyze real estate prices in France.
The data file can't be dowloaded because of its size (much larger than 25MB). You can find it on the French government website by searching for "Valeur fonci√®res {year}"

# A Django repo will also be provided soon
